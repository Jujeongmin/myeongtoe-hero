/**
 * A localStorage that never throws.
 *
 * The Verse8 editor frames the game from another site, so in the preview we are a third-party
 * context and the browser may refuse storage outright. @agent8/gameserver reads and writes
 * localStorage while its module is being evaluated, unguarded, so a refusal takes the whole import
 * chain down and the game never mounts. When the real store is unusable it is swapped for an
 * in-memory one for the session. Imported first in main.tsx, ahead of anything that touches storage.
 * (From grove hunters, where this was found: docs/VERSE8-EDITOR.md.)
